      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class="bioText">A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that shows activities such as tasks or events displayed against time. On the left is a list of activities and on the top is a time scale. Each activity is represented by a bar, and the position and length of the bar reflects the start data, duration and end data of the activity. The dependency relationships between activites can also be showed from the graph. It is commonly used in project schedule and employee rostering. The data suitable for the Gantt chart is data for activities with time related features. To create it, a list of target activities, the starting time, the time frame of these activities and possibly the relationship between these activities are needed. The basic Gantt chart can be built through Excel Bar chart function. However, various software such as Microsoft Project, MindView and Celoxis can create more sophisticate charts.<br><br>The Gantt chart is easy and clear to keep track of various activities or project; for instance, how the tasks relate to each other, how far each task has progressed and so on. But it's complicated and inefficient to build and update the chart manually. The chart needs to be continually updated as the time goes by due to the continual changing feature of most projects.<br><br>The first Gantt chart was devised in the mid 1890s by Karol Adamiecki. But the chart is named after Henry Gantt, an American engineer and management consultant, who designed his own version of the chart and made it popular in western countries. Most project management tools nowadays are based on the idea of Gantt Charts.</p>
